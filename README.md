## My process

The initial process was to divide the output image into components and start from the most basic compoenent, in our case, it will be the QR code itself. Once you have placed the QR code image by itself, I continued building on top of it by adding the text and changing background colors and finally ensure that the view is responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
